Attributes are pretty self-explanatory. They are the data that modules use to do their work. They can be anything from a simple string to a complex object.

## Making Your Attribute Known

Just like modules, attributes are added with a standard extender. Attributes are scoped by module type.

```php
// extend.php
use OrdinaryJellyfish\Sentra\Extend\Attributes;

return [
  (new Attributes('post-analysis'))
    ->add(MyAttribute::class),
];
```

## Writing Your Attribute

Attributes are simpler than modules. You only need to implement one method: `handle`.

```php
// MyAttribute.php
class MyAttribute
{
  public function handle(Post $post, User $user): array
  {
    return [
      'key' => 'value',
    ]
  }
}
```
