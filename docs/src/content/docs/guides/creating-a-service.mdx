Services are optional classes that create attributes for your modules to access. They are useful for creating reusable functionality that can be shared across multiple modules.

## Making Your Service Known

Just like modules, services are added with a standard extender. Services are scoped by module type.

```php
// extend.php
use OrdinaryJellyfish\Sentra\Extend\Services;

return [
  (new Services('post-analysis'))
    ->add(MyService::class),
];
```

## Writing Your Service


```php
// MyService.php
use OrdinaryJellyfish\Sentra\Services\ServiceInterface;

class MyService implements ServiceInterface
{
  public function getKey(): string
  {
    // This is the same key you use in the frontend and in modules, this will ensure that the service is enabled before it is run in the backend.
    return 'key';
  }

  public function handle(Post $post, User $user): array
  {
    // Run functionality here

    return [
      'key' => 'value',
    ]
  }
}
```
